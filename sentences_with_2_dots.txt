1: i'd go with Michael Nelson, he has too many names.
1: I don't even want to type them all.
1: 'Jr.'
1: I'll say Michael Nelson Jr., or me.
1: I can't vote for myself, but that's not bad. I'll give you moral support.

1: :/ i'm not mafia... 
1: Christopher's turn....
1: Why would it be me Brandon & Michael? I voted against the mafia last round... Maybe you two are part of it to?
1: It might be Jonathan Kim... killing off Erin who accused him "yesterday"
1: It doesn't make sense to be Cristian.

1: Mafia is gonna win cause you are idiots.
1: natalie... that sounds like someone in the mafia 
1: see they voted natalie out...other person that wanted her out was Nathan. He's the next mafia

1: try..hahahah
1: I agree. Let's eliminate Natalie.
1: Even Natalie agrees that Natalie cannot be trusted.
1: I am not mafia. 
1: Stephen Baldwin... that guy has been in quite a few movies, I bet he's got mob connections. I vote Stephen Baldwin is the mafioso! 
1: Agreed, Baldwin was very quick to throw her under the bus. 
1: Sounds like something a mob boss would say. 
1: Nathan was quick to point his finger at Natalie.
1: If you ask me, that means Kevin Morales might well be a mafia. 
1: Aaron wanted Kevin Morales gone.
1: It turns out that Natalie was indeed a member of the mafia.
1: Since I voted for Natalie to be eliminated, that means I'm not a mafia. Latoya, on the other hand, wanted me gone.
1: If I were a member of the Mafia, why would I vote to have a fellow Mafioso eliminated? Clearly I'm a bystander. 
1: Nathan did want Natalie gone though...
1: Very few of us left, wow. Good morning, brave few. 
1: Natalie was rotten all along. What about you, Nathan? Have you been active at night lately?

1: Was Jacob not here the whole chat of "day 1"?  If so... maybe vote Jacob?
1: Hey, I still have all these nooses. Gotta use them up.
1: Yes, I clearly suck at this game.  No argument from me!  
1: I would defo be the least competent mafia person ever.  I'm with you, Stacy.
1: Benyamin is correct.
1: I guarantee you I'm not mafia, but do what you gotta do.
1: 39 minutes and no bonus...might be underpaid? lol
1: Harold could you restate your question.
1: It seems like the current consensus. 
1: I'm not smart enough to be mafia.
1: We have no information about people.
1: I am guessing Harold.
1: I really dislike this randomly generated name.
1: Rebecca seemed quick to the draw.
1: so....i'm not sure what's going on
1: Morning at last.
1: Who's next...
1: Wish they would have made this like the actual game. All we can do is just randomly pick people lol
1: I'm a bystander too.  Girl named Rodney  lol
1: I'm a bystander...and a girl, I guess.
1: Okay, let's go with him.
1: Aw Scott, now I'm feeling sorry for you.
1: They said you, not me.  I just went along....
1: I'm a bystander too... NOT MAFIA.. not a bot.
1: Just don't captcha me dude.
1: I pretty much guess they won't say.. right?
1: Oh my God I'm alive.
1: nope nope nope..it isn't me.. I promise.
1: Don't do it.. I'm really not a Mafia.
1: I'm...Melting,.,
1: Yeah.. that's what all the Nazis said.
1: :-( sorry.
1: I think you all should worry about Ashley. Why would she single me out?
1: hello. not me!
1: Cory Baron. Everyone vote Cory Baron.
1: No idea who mafia might be...
1: Nicholas Davis sounds shifty...oh wait.
1: There doesn't seem to be any evidence for it.
1: Danielle said "Jill Mcdonald AFTER CORY" and then she disappeared. It's obvious
1: Probably Alicia then.
1: sadness.  I have kids
1: I've been playing it my whole life.  
1: Reminds me of IT.  We all float down here
1: You tell me. I've got your back. 
1: I think so Joshua.
1: hello.
1: I got interupted before I got to answer the ballons questions.  99 of them Paul. 99 Red Balloons.
1: You did it to yourself. 
1: My vote didn't go through last time.  
1: You seem to be really connected to the family, like a Targaryen.
1: Brent made the best lampredotto.
1: Ryan: LOL, now that's stuck in my head. ;)
1: bystander here too Terri Green. It is very nice to meet you all
1: haha didn't see that coming....
1: I'm sorry if I'm wrong Bryan...
1: Hey! I'm  bystander like y'all.
1: Hey guys.
1: Maybe "Don't Stop Believin'" will just kick in as you leave.
1: Who is in the mafia? Hmm...
1: It shows what people are voting for.
1: No idea who to eliminate.
1: Mafia can't send messages at night.
1: anyone have anything to offer. i dont even know what would be suspicious
1: Yeah. We don't really have anything else to go on now, you know?
1: Well then. Guess it wasn't either of those guys
1: Also hi. 
1: I agree. Matthew is
1: Agreed. Amanda is mafia.
1: I'm down with that.
1: Interesting, would make sense Vanessa is mafia. 
1: Glad he's gone. He gave me crabs
1: Yeah, Elizabeth is lacking some compassion here. Seems like a bad guy imo.
1: I bet elizabeth did it. Just look at that evil laugh. Just sayin.
1: Don't vote for Elizabeth, make them suffer and wait.
1: Good job Jordan. Feeling like a little murder today?
1: Michelle is really quiet, whats up with that? You think the killer is gonna talk? No way, they are gonna be silent and invisible.
1: .... my spelling sucks.
1: So, let's just confess. If you're the mafia, say so!
1: Wow, good job Michelle, still killing without retribution I see.
1: The mafia has raptors, I'm sure.
1: Sure, I'll sheep vote.
1: I just realized, I had to push vote xD Oops. I haven't been voting
1: I say vote michelle. That silence is deadly.
1: This is such a stupid game. I'm a bystander, but kill me anyways, want to get on with my day
1: Never mess with Michelle on her period.
1: Just look at the denial from Michelle. I'm telling you, prime suspect, just saying.
1: And wtg, Michelle.
1: I'd say that too.
1: Evil, saucy minx, you.
1: Lol Michelle. 
1: You're right, dakota isn't talking.
1: I'm scared.
1: I'll vote for you, because you're sinister enough. You're a money hungry, hoarse horse.
1: Wow.
1: This does NOT look good for me.
1: Well, Ryan probably asked for it anyways.
1: I would assume.
1: Awkward silence.
1: Jake Pierce sounds like a hard core name.
1: If I was mafia, I'd want Jake Pierce to be my name. Very suave.
1: I read it in The Sun.
1: <-clearly evil mastermind. 
1: Getting really suspicious of you silent, murder-y types.
1: Of course I'm right,.
1: I'm Jordan effing Rojas.
1: With a name like this, I'm probably a coffee/cocaine tycoon. 
1: Jesus Michelle, what is wrong with you. Did they not pay you enough?
1: Hi. 
1: Welp they weren't mafia.... so there are only a few choices left
1: Well no.
1: Could be any of us. Its just a guess.
1: lolol i know...I think Dr. Amy should be next to go
1: that's not nice, dr. amy! 
1: Say goodnight.
1: Was thinking her as well.
1: Mary.
1: Then Jamie.
1: Sorry Damon.
1: Good enough for me, Alexander Lopez sleeps with the fishes tonight.
1: Ricardo vote for yourself. Your fate has been decided

1: Frank... and I think we win?
1: Nice being criminals with you.
1: hmm..
1: nobody thinks im mafia...
1: Alright.
1: Deborah should probably be next since she is throwing people under the bus...sounds just like mafia
1: A bit too eager...
1: Patrick was a bystander who probably snitched. Snitches get stitches. :`(
1: Yeah I heard she laundered money to the Mafia along with Christina Morgan.
1: Poor Shane.
1: I've loved Shane since highschool.
1: I think angela is mafia....she wanted him gone
1: Shane Landry... Landry. Laundry. Laundered money to the mafia!
1: Not close enough to know he wasn't mafia.
1: So be it . . .
1: Apparently ditches in Patricks case...
1: The neighborhoods thinning out too quickly.
1: Too late now, I never got to say goodbye.
1: I forgive him.
1: I'll vote Angela.
1: Shane how could you vote for Patrick?! Taken in his prime... you monster I can never forgive you.
1: If you look up I never voted for Patrick.
1: Shand piled on with Deb.  Guilt by association!!!
