It seems really weird that they'd eliminate the only other person with accusations

I don't see him on here conversing 
Words: hi

i think the timer's a bit long for the night and day sessions. everyone have a good evening!

I think Christina will believe us

hi all
Words: hi

ya this is the worst
Words: hi

I think Donna talks a lot and tries to confuse us. 
Words: hi

why'd the mob whack the person everyone was voting for they should've left him alive to distract from them
Words: hey, hi

or did they?
Words: hey

guys not playin, so lets knock him out
Words: hi

The neighborhoods thinning out too quickly.

I think so. Because mafia know who the other mafia are, and probably wouldn't kill their own
Words: hi

I was thinking 2nd. 
Words: hi

they pushed julian in the beginni

too much scrolling in this =/
Words: hi

Welp they weren't mafia.... so there are only a few choices left

timer is fast, didn't know which Erin
Words: hi

Hi, bystanders!  Seems to me if we're smart, and we have more than the mafia, we can win this if we're smart
Words: hi

kimberly this time?
Words: hi

Yeah, I think William seems to be the popular choice.
Words: hi

This is such a stupid game. I'm a bystander, but kill me anyways, want to get on with my day
Words: hi

ok i think mary mata
Words: hi

this is like Survivor

Words: hi, hey

I say we leave up troy, his shtick is too terrible
Words: hi

anything to say for yourself kevin
Words: hi

Ernest seemed vocal - should we pick him and then vote Blake when it is everyone
Words: hi

Sounds like something a mob boss would say. 
Words: hi

I think it could be either.
Words: hi

I don't understand this at all
Words: hi

well they win as soon as they have as many members as there are bystanders left
Words: hey, hey

Just 2 I think
Words: hi

I still think Jay myself

Words: hi

hi
Words: hi

hey
Words: hey

One name is as good as another at this point, I guess

They said you, not me.  I just went along....
Words: hey

100% cynthia

Seemed like Angela and him were close
Words: hi

hi guys
Words: hi

I'm not sure who else may be involved since nothing happened at night
Words: hi

thomas was the last to come around on sara lets go with him
Words: hi

idk john voted for cynthia that's the only lead

But they can vote twice so ignore me
Words: hey

I think we should hold off on Chris, and take someone else out
Words: hi

Words: hi

I really dislike this randomly generated name.
Words: hi

Hey Jodi, who do you think is in the Mafia?
Words: hi

well you didn't vote for michael, i think that makes sense
Words: hi

Something suspicious about Christopher Turner
Words: hi

forgot my coffee and it's been downhill since
Words: hi

christopher smith said only hello
Words: hello

With a name like this, I'm probably a coffee/cocaine tycoon. 
Words: hi

lolol i know...I think Dr. Amy should be next to go
Words: hi

I forgive him.
Words: hi

who do you think?
Words: hi

hey!
Words: hey

What makes you think she knew that?
Words: hi

well i guess we're killing this guy
Words: hi

It might be Jonathan Kim... killing off Erin who accused him "yesterday"
Words: hi

They have no idea yet. :)
Words: hey

exactly what i was thinking
Words: hi

I've loved Shane since highschool.
Words: hi

and diana I think
Words: hi

Walker is trying to turn  you against me so he can kill you himself.
Words: hi

who's the mouthiest???
Words: hi

how about that woman that jumped into the jaguar exhibit in Arizona today. Bold move
Words: hi

I think its Blake
Words: hi

No because no one said anything.
Words: hi

I don't know how anyone's sure of anything
Words: hi

Things that make you go "hmm"
Words: hi

holy crap they killed our only lead
Words: hey

Looks like this should be a win for the mafia if I'm eliminated
Words: hi

this is mturk so yes
Words: hi

And hello
Words: hello

who thinks Johnny is Mafia?
Words: hi

hello
Words: hello

get him!
Words: hi

I think it's Henry, too quiet
Words: hi

you wouldn't hurt this face!
Words: hi

amanda is history
Words: hi

Well who is left, what do you all think, who could it be
Words: hi

hmmm it seems like they might go blake next round
Words: hey

Probably should kill Jerry, since he thinks I'm mafia, haha
Words: hi

hello all!
Words: hello

Is there a point to this?
Words: hi

trying to hill you 
Words: hi

This game obviously needs a bonus that's what I think
Words: hi, hi

jacob hasn't really said anything until now which is suspicious
Words: hi, hi

I think Gregory is throwing around a lot of accusations.
Words: hi

I wonder if there is a trick to this.  Like if the names mean anything
Words: hi, hi

I think you all should worry about Ashley. Why would she single me out?
Words: hi

I think our mafia member radars are off
Words: hi

who do you think the mafia is
Words: hi

what you think?
Words: hi

Then they'll know it was you
Words: hey

I'm hit!
Words: hi

this is gold
Words: hi

Also hi. 
Words: hi

which one of ya is it
Words: hi

So who do we think is in the Mafia? 
Words: hi

imma psychic
Words: hi

True, I'm used to watching reactions and hearing tone of voice.
Words: hi

i'm just trying to think strategically. they seemed like they agreed on things
Words: hi, hey, hey, hi

This game can easily make one feel paranoid...
Words: hi

Ya, this is boring
Words: hi

i asked if we got him cause i thought we won
Words: hi

somebody must have dropped or something
Words: hi

Morning! Who do you think we should eliminate today?
Words: hi

I think so.
Words: hi

see they voted natalie out...other person that wanted her out was Nathan. He's the next mafia
Words: hey

I have no idea at this point honestly.
Words: hi

Frank... and I think we win?
Words: hi

Ashley is history
Words: hi

does that mean there's one mafia left? are we all bystanders? how does this work haha
Words: hi

I think we can get people to turn on Nicole because she stuck up for sam
Words: hi

I'm thinking Kelly
Words: hi

Was thinking her as well.
Words: hi

THats such a mafia thing to say!!
Words: hi

I swear this timer moves slower than normal
Words: hi

Any ideas this round?
Words: hi

if nothing else it's amusing
Words: hi

I did not thinking I could be next!!!
Words: hi

What are we supposed to base this vote on?  My button says "vote (note changeable)"
Words: hi

hey everybody
Words: hey

Yeah. We don't really have anything else to go on now, you know?
Words: hi

At this point it doesn't matter I guess
Words: hi

this just got intersting 
Words: hi

Just don't hold anything against me if I voted for you and you survive!
Words: hi

This game is harder when you can't interact in person and read people's body language
Words: hi

Nathan was quick to point his finger at Natalie.
Words: hi

you know jennifer hasn't said anything yet
Words: hi

Yeah I think that is a good plan
Words: hi

so what are we thinking
Words: hi

Hi, this is Ricky, don't vote for me!
Words: hi

Unless they killed him to make us confused
Words: hey, hi

makes you think
Words: hi

I think we should eliminate Carla
Words: hi

I think it's random
Words: hi

haha yeah i was thinking that, but they might not notice
Words: hi, hey

I vote for Benjamin this time
Words: hi

This does NOT look good for me.
Words: hi

nobody thinks im mafia...
Words: hi

m just trying to get this party started
Words: hi

I don't think michelle has talked either
Words: hi

which is why I say we all randomly pick
Words: hi

I think scott is sketchy
Words: hi

no but i argued a lot against brittany figured theyd off me in the night tbh
Words: hey

lol guess they're not that smart.
Words: hey

Whoa sorry about that my page suddenly scrolled down and I thought time was up and just hit vote
Words: hi

you pick this time
Words: hi

hi yall
Words: hi

Hmm, I think we should actually vote out Ricky. He seems too eager to kick people out.
Words: hi

hey all
Words: hey

so I think Derek is mafia
Words: hi

love this
Words: hi

hmmm let's get rid of nicole I think
Words: hi

Wish they would have made this like the actual game. All we can do is just randomly pick people lol
Words: hey, hi

hello everyone
Words: hello

impossible like this
Words: hi

He did suggest Jason last round, and I don't think Jason was actually mafia...
Words: hi

sorry Zachary (if you're still watching)
Words: hi

Who do you think now?
Words: hi

hey how r u
Words: hey

I doubt he's still watching
Words: hi

I think that the best approach is to wait until the very end to vote
Words: hi

She threw him under the bus about patrick, who was also a bystander
Words: hi

I think kelly
Words: hi

maybe james lamb but he changed choices this time maybe to throw off
Words: hi

Okay, let's go with him.
Words: hi

yes i was thinking the same
Words: hi

still going with Ruben....nothing but crickets from him/her
Words: hi, hi

i'm not sure. i think carla is a bystander
Words: hi

I'm not, but I certainly can see how it would be suspicious. At this point, I don't know what's going on
Words: hi

Not this time lol
Words: hi

But if it a tie, the machine picks!
Words: hi

Nicholas Davis sounds shifty...oh wait.
Words: hi

I'd almost say vote me out so I can complete this HIT faster lol
Words: hi

Ruben already voted this round for Alexander....
Words: hi

trying to think what we can go off
Words: hi

if you are mafia just respond to this 
Words: hi

Nothing much here.. got a good nights rest
Words: hi

who are we going to eliminate next round? not this one. let's think in advance
Words: hi, hi

hi all!
Words: hi

hello 
Words: hello

Words: hi

Words: hi

This experiment is ridiculous

Words: hi

Okay Jacob, after you this time
Words: hi

Words: hi

Kayla hasnt replied in awhile, bye!

Words: hi

Words: hi

Kind of natural at this point
Words: hi

Kill me cause i'm sick of this stupid game
Words: hi

he could have voted for cynthia to try to provide her cover
Words: hi

this is gonnna be harder than i thought, lol
Words: hi

Yes, I clearly suck at this game.  No argument from me!  
Words: hi

where is everybody getting this info?
Words: hi

Nicholas Ross is my pick this time
Words: hi

Jesus Michelle, what is wrong with you. Did they not pay you enough?
Words: hey
