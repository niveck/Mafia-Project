341,"lastname is mafia, eliminate her",25,
614,"firstname made an accusation before discussing, so firstname is probably mafia.",25,
645,"too many people saying firstname, they are probably mafia",25,
659,"probably should kill firstname, since he thinks i'm mafia, haha",25,
690,firstname doesn't sound mafia. but it could be a trap.,25,
693,sam if firstname isn't mafia i'm assuming you are,25,

1134,firstname... that sounds like someone in the mafia ,25,
1174,"if you ask me, that means firstname lastname might well be a mafia. ",25,
1180,it turns out that firstname was indeed a member of the mafia.,25,
1247,so i think firstname is mafia,25,
1250,"i would defo be the least competent mafia person ever.  i'm with you, firstname.",25,
1332,well sounds like firstname is mafia,25,
1341,the three that picked firstname are probably mafia!,25,

439,suspicious*,27,
564,"that sounded a lastname suspicious, just saying",27,
610,kind of suspicious to just vote for a random guy first before discussion.,27,

64,"i think so. because mafia know who the other mafia are, and probably wouldn't kill their own",47,
122,i wonder if the mob is purposefully not getting rid of people at night and instead trying to do it during the day? how many can be in the mafia? ,47,
317,i knew because i played mafia on epicmafia where that kind of slip happens all the time,47,
484,only mafia can talk at night,47,

929,well it seems the mafia missed their first chance mwuhaha,47,
979,what mafia meeting?,47,
991,probably know hes not mafia,47,
1085,dance fighting is how all mafia disputes are settled,47,
1110,maybe quiet is a bystander trying to stay away from the mafia,47,
1659,maybe the people who are all voting the same the first day are mafia?,47,
1665,only mafia can talk and vote at night,47,
1668,mafia can't send messages at night.,47,

86,firstname lastname as in the failed politician? lol,71,
115,firstname was the first voter last time...,71,
187,"firstname lastname was pretty quick to cast her vote, seems suspicious to me",71,
293,idk firstname voted for firstname that's the only lead,71,
295,he could have voted for firstname to try to provide her cover,71,
316,firstname was also the last to vote firstname.,71,
413,"well, no it looks like firstname voted firstname",71,
593,what i realized now is that the people voting during the day are most likely bystanders meaning lastname ... and she voted a mafia out >_<,71,
623,"i see why firstname voted you, because you voted her first, lol",71,
753,he voted for firstname with no justification though,71,
782,firstname hasn't spoken and she hasn't been voting in the most recent rounds,71,
820,"since firstname voted me on first round, i will vote her now.",71,
822,i just noticed (looking back at round 1) that firstname lastname did end up voting.,71,
888,"so, does that mean vote firstname?",71,
959,firstname was trying to vote you out firstname,71,
1012,maybe firstname bc she didn't vote for firstname?,71,
1041,"well you didn't vote for firstname, i think that makes sense",71,
1115,has firstname lastname voted at all??,71,
1154,notice that firstname was eliminated last night?,71,
1240,"was firstname not here the whole chat of ""day 1""?  if so... maybe vote firstname?",71,
1383,"firstname seems vaguely leader like, so i voted for her",71,
1765,she voted you out with firstname,71,
1767,firstname makes me nervous she voted me ,71,
1771,firstname - did you not vote last round? any suspicions?,71,
2202,if you look up i never voted for firstname.,71,
8,you couldn't have chosen firstname in the last phase as a bystander,72,
60,"you guys are making a mistake killing me, i'm firstname lastname, the best bystander in the world",72,
315,i am a bystander though since i lead the firstname lastname.,72,
451,i'm not sure. i think firstname is a bystander,72,
569,"that's fine. seriously, gotta lastname. can kick me out but i am a bystander as you'll soon see :)",72,
900,firstname was a bystander,72,
1411,i'm a bystander too.  girl named firstname  lol,72,
1548,firstname playing dumb to stay alive?,72,
1579,i wonder how many of the voters for firstname knew he was a bystander,72,
1587,i'm not sure i'm a bystander named firstname lastname,72,
1589,bystander here too firstname lastname. it is very nice to meet you all,72,
1938,firstname are you a bystander?,72,

24,firstname is too wise,82,
53,"okay, so we're going to go with firstname?",82,
91,let's do firstname or firstname ,82,
93,firstname then,82,
141,i'm going with firstname on this one,82,
181,go for firstname,82,
182,or firstname,82,
192,i say firstname is next,82,
255,"yeah, i think firstname seems to be the popular choice.",82,
356,ok how about firstname ,82,
555,what about firstname?,82,
601,i'll go with firstname lastname,82,
607,firstname was the last to come around on firstname lets go with him,82,
644,go after firstname or firstname,82,
667,i'm thinking firstname,82,
681,hmmm what about firstname,82,
756,how about firstname?,82,
802,firstname then,82,
821,i agree with firstname,82,
835,still going with firstname....nothing but crickets from him/her,82,
836,i'm leaning toward firstname as well,82,
849,"maybe firstname then, idk",82,
894,firstname talked second so has to be him,82,
1031,"i'd go with firstname lastname, he has too many names.",82,
1035,"i'll say firstname lastname jr., or me.",82,
1112,still leaning towards firstname,82,
1207,"so, firstname is the other, right?",82,
1229,i'm going with firstname sorry :-[,82,
1239,so firstname for sure?,82,
1257,go with firstname then,82,
1317,firstname could you restate your question.,82,
1351,"okay, i'll go with firstname",82,
1352,anyone have any other suggestions it's currently between firstname and firstname,82,
1430,i think firstname is sketchy,82,
1440,"let's go with firstname, then during the day let's go with firstname",82,
1499,or firstname for that matter,82,
1516,probably firstname then.,82,
1532,firstname then firstname,82,
1537,firstname lastname sounds like a good choice,82,
1564,think what firstname?,82,
1685,i say firstname,82,
1689,firstname vs firstname,82,
1717,i agree. firstname is,82,
1888,then who besides firstname?,82,
1940,what about firstname?,82,
1993,yes i say firstname lastname,82,
2015,i say firstname,82,
2017,i say firstname,82,
2020,firstname are you sure about firstname or firstname?,82,
2025,ok i think firstname lastname,82,
2034,then firstname.,82,
2073,"lastname or firstname, maybe?",82,
2122,going with firstname again,82,
87,she isn't talking sounds like a mob goon to me,83,
101,why'd the mob whack the person everyone was voting for they should've left him alive to distract from them,83,
112,hmmm again the mob did a no kill,83,
138,so far we haven't found any mob goons,83,
764,the instructions made it sound pretty equal,83,
998,sounds like a mobish name,83,
1034,sounds mobbed up,83,
1132,i'll make my own mob out of these bystanders,83,
1158,sounds like something a mob boss would say. ,83,
1214,too quiet.,83,
1511,mobster for sure,83,
1547,reminds me of it.  we all float down here,83,
1585,who is the mob person ?,83,
1601,i'm not sure what to do now i have no idea who is left in the mob and i don't want to eliminate a bystander by mistake lol,83,
1818,a hoarse horse,83,
1839,pitch forks! get that silent but deadly outta here!,83,
1856,pitch forks a ready!,83,
2183,the neighborhoods thinning out too quickly.,83,
172,damn those instant votes,84,
397,how do we vote?,84,
575,why we voting so fast?,84,
584,who hasn't been voting during the day then?,84,
587,but they can vote twice so ignore me,84,
694,because you tried to get people to vote right away,84,
816,i think that the best approach is to wait until the very end to vote,84,
873,"so, are we all voting randomly?",84,
927,i mean probably vote with 30 seconds left at least.,84,
1069,"most votes, if tie then its random between the two",84,
1087,do the votes have to be unanimous or just 'most votes wins',84,
1212,your votes keep winning.,84,
1245,or the person didn't know how to vote,84,
1279,4 votes? people afk?,84,
1361,i just loaded in and had a vote already somehow?,84,
1660,it shows what people are voting for.,84,
