572,its a hard life being the only man,86
573,hello,38
574,well great lol,55
575,why we voting so fast?,84
576,what did firstname do,51
577,i did the first round purely because it sounded mafia like but i'm observing who hasn't voted proven mafia now,47
578,you know firstname hasn't said anything yet,51
579,hello!,26
580,that went well,66
581,hello any researching reading my thoughts,99
582,researcher*,22
583,"welcome, it's quite lonely",55
584,who hasn't been voting during the day then?,84
585,forgot my coffee and it's been downhill since,81
586,we'll see if i can keep firstname on my side,93
587,but they can vote twice so ignore me,84
588,it's been a long monday here lol,81
589,yeah same,43
590,hi,8
591,that's exactly what a mafioso would say,9
592,it's so random,46
593,what i realized now is that the people voting during the day are most likely bystanders meaning lastname ... and she voted a mafia out >_<,71
594,hey,73
595,its been a slow monday,81
596,eliminate lastname,59
597,sup yall,22

606,"yo, who do you think?",48
607,firstname was the last to come around on firstname lets go with him,82
608,sorry make that firstname lastname,37
609,are we really just going random names or do we have a real reason,46
610,kind of suspicious to just vote for a random guy first before discussion.,27
611,lastname was too willing to go after lastname,1
612,agree,15
613,i agree with lastname,1
614,"firstname made an accusation before discussing, so firstname is probably mafia.",25
615,firstname firstname is too smart for her own good.,51
616,1,77
617,12,92
618,12,92
619,firstname lastname,23
620,good think,79
621,exactly what i was thinking,99
622,lastname led the mob against lastname and he was wrong suspecious?,14
623,"i see why firstname voted you, because you voted her first, lol",71
624,i feel bad.,74
625,you were the first to ever vote.,12
626,that's cuz you're comfortable with the user interface already.,89
627,why not,63
628,"not me, how about lastname",88
629,yeah,21
630,just a guess,33
631,firstname lastname?,23
632,sure,31
633,ok,7
634,eliminate mathew lastname,59
635,firstname,3
636,who do you think is a mafia member?,56
637,"wow, looks like firstname isn't having any luck",51
638,i think the timer's a bit long for the night and day sessions. everyone have a good evening!,61
639,no joke,36
640,let's take firstname lastname out of the game.,59
641,who do you want to get?,76
642,firstname lastname?,23
643,ok,7
644,go after firstname or firstname,82
645,"too many people saying firstname, they are probably mafia",25
646,this game is harder when you can't interact in person and read people's body language,52
647,i like firstname,93
648,i'll go with the group,24
649,"he did suggest firstname last round, and i don't think firstname was actually mafia...",14
650,i sa firstname,93
651,are we doing firstname?,53
652,hmm,13
653,"oh, that's true",75
654,true,75
655,i missed that,36
656,i vote firstname,57
657,"true, i'm used to watching reactions and hearing tone of voice.",10
658,i only suggested firstname because he suggested me. live and let live otherwise,51
659,"probably should kill firstname, since he thinks i'm mafia, haha",25
660,who should we get?,94
661,yes i was thinking the same,99
662,or would that be too obvious?,17
663,"eh, let's do it",18
664,it might be,33
665,ok,7
666,i believe firstname lastname,98
667,i'm thinking firstname,82
668,i think firstname,98
669,i am also firstname,93
670,"don't go after firstname, he's just an innocent um",51
671,mafioso!,9
672,i still think firstname myself ,53
673,how is mafia,56
674,"firstname said to kill firstname last round, haha",53
675,"yeah, that would be nice",79

681,hmmm what about firstname,82
682,hello,38
683,hi!,8
684,how many of us are there?,96
685,i don't think it matters who we pick for the first night really since we don't know anything,76
686,just 2 i think,96
687,why?,63
688,poor guy,67
689,no way to tell,70
690,firstname doesn't sound mafia. but it could be a trap.,25
691,welp votes aren't changeable ,41
692,firstname is a nice name!,93
693,sam if firstname isn't mafia i'm assuming you are,25
694,because you tried to get people to vote right away,84
695,why did the timer start over?,61
696,only a small amount of time left!,50
697,40 seconds for me,61
698,hmmmmm,13
699,let's get firstname,53
700,"ok, sounds good",18
701,i can't believe how many of them there are!,96
702,hi,8
703,hello,38

722,so much for my lastname ideas,1
723,sam it is,22
724,if nothing else it's amusing,86

729,lol,34
730,lets get rid of firstname lastname,59

750,well i think sam is alright,74
751,he keeps trying to get rid of people,30
752,wth,22
753,he voted for firstname with no justification though,71
754,ah! can't vote for myself,12
755,yea...,42
756,how about firstname?,82
757,ok!,7
758,he hasn't said much.,58
759,ok,7
760,i think we can get people to turn on firstname because she stuck up for sam,53
761,slowly but surely . . .,70
762,well there's at least one mafia left,56
763,do we know how many total there are?,96
764,the instructions made it sound pretty equal,83
765,there are as many as there ever were,96
766,who hasn't talked at all?,58
767,i thought mafia had to outnumber bystanders to win,47
768,i don't think firstname has talked either,51
769,who's next?,48
770,we're doing good,81
771,hmmm let's get rid of firstname i think,59
772,ok,7
773,since no one else is speaking,58
774,it said at least one i think,96
775,well they win as soon as they have as many members as there are bystanders left,6
776,firstname,3
777,anything to say for yourself firstname,93
778,totally guilty,87
779,aw,77
780,well going after firstname was a mistake.  ,51
781,sigh,85
782,firstname hasn't spoken and she hasn't been voting in the most recent rounds,71
783,haha,2
784,so she could be afk or not wanting to look suspicious,27
785,true,75
786,would be easier if we could see hats,79
787,seriously!,50
788,that sounds like something mafia would say,47
789,if only we had a secret language,58
790,i'm not mafia guys :(,56

817,8 people left?,6
818,not a clue,20
819,"going for people who aren't participating first though so, sorry firstname",37
820,"since firstname voted me on first round, i will vote her now.",71
